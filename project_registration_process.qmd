title: Project Registration Process
---

Once you have an idea of what you want your project to be, please post in the [#new_project_airlock](https://hsma-workspace.slack.com/archives/C074HBCAGGM) Slack channel with a brief description of any project you'd like to register as a HSMA project.

The team will then create you a channel on Slack to use for project discussions, and register your project on the current HSMA project register.

You don't need to do anything more formal than that - you can start cracking on with your project work and use your project channel to reach out to the HSMA community for help.

:::{.callout-note}
While we provide a [project design template](https://bergam0t.github.io/hsma_project_handbook/project_design_template.html), this is **entirely optional** and is only designed to guide your thinking. If you have filled it out, it is helpful for us if you submit it along with your brief project description in the [#new_project_airlock](https://hsma-workspace.slack.com/archives/C074HBCAGGM) - but you do not have to fill in every field, or even fill it in at all if you don't find it helpful!!

HSMA projects must meet a few criteria

- They must use a method we teach on the HSMA course
    - the method can be related to a method we teach - for example, if you wished to use a time series forecasting method we haven't taught, this would be ok, but we may be able to provide less detailed support than for a technique we have taught
- It must use free and open source methods
- It must be in the area of health, social care, policing,
