:::{.callout-note}
The template is entirely optional - please feel free to use it, not use it, only fill in the fields you find useful for you, add fields, etc.

If you do fill it out, it is helpful for us if you submit it along with your brief project description in the [#new_project_airlock](https://hsma-workspace.slack.com/archives/C074HBCAGGM) - but you do not have to fill in every field, or even fill it in at all if you don't find it helpful!!
