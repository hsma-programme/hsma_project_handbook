This model used system dynamics to "simulate the factors that influence a call being made for an ambulance."

> "We compared predicted ambulance demand over 12 months in the base case model with scenarios in which each influencing factor was removed in turn.

> The model predicts that the prevalence of regular falls among older people most influences the level of demand for ambulances. The model also predicts that the number of users of adult mental health services could be a significant contributor to ambulance demand."
