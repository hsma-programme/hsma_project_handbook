> "Our aim was to develop a generic computer model that could estimate resources required for end-of-life (EoL) care delivery during the pandemic."

> "The model predicts the per-day ‘staff’ and ‘stuff’ resourcing required to meet a given level of incoming EoL care activity."


> "A mean of 11.97 hours of additional community nurse time, up to 33 hours of care assistant time and up to 30 hours additional care from care assistant night sits will be required per day as a result of out of hospital COVID-19 deaths based on the model prediction. Specialist palliative care demand is predicted to increase up to 19 hours per day. An additional 286 anticipatory medicine bundles per month will be necessary to alleviate physical symptoms at the EoL care for patients with COVID-19: an average additional 10.21 bundles of anticipatory medication per day. An average additional 9.35 syringe pumps could be needed to be in use per day."
