This work looks at predicting the beds required across different specialties in hospitals on a short-term basis.

The output brings together 

- patients on the ward with a decision to admit
- patients currently in the hospital who are predicted to need a bed in the next 8 hours
- patients expected to arrive at the hospital who are predicted to need a bed in the next 8 hours
