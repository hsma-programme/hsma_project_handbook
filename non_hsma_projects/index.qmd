Looking at projects undertaken by teams more widely across the NHS and academia could give you additional inspiration for your own project.

Click on the project title to read a summary and find links to more details.

Not all authors are listed in the summary pages - we have just provided the names of those involved in the projects who are part of the HSMA community or the HSMA trainers have some link with (and may therefore be able to link you up with too).
