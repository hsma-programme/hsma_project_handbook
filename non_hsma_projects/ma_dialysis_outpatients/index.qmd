In this project, the number of ambulances required for patient transport of covid-positive patients during the pandemic was explored.

It modelled the likely number of covid-positive dialysis patients in the region during different phases of the pandemic.

The model showed that by relaxing travel policies slightly to allow transport of two covid-positive patients in the same vehicle, the number of driver hours required per day would reduce by 40-60%.
