This proejct involved building a forecasting model for the South West Ambulance Services Trust. 

What was created was "a bespoke forecasting model, capable of predicting Call, Incident and Response data by hour for a period of up to 6 weeks or daily over 365 days. The Forecasting & Capacity Planning Team at SWASFT then used Python and SQL computer modelling software to convert the forecast models into useable rota patterns. The project has resulted in a fully automated, accurate and safe demand-led resourcing model."

The work used an ensemble of different time series forecasts with a proven ability to match real-world patterns.
