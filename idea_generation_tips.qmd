# Tips for Generating Project Ideas

If you are struggling to get started with project ideas, here are a couple of prompts to help.

1. Take a look at the [previous HSMA projects](previous_projects/index.qmd)

2. Think about the areas of the course you most enjoyed. While the needs of the organisation need to come first, it's also helpful to consider the areas of the course you

- found the most interesting
- felt you broadly understood (don't feel you have to be an expert yet - you will practice and develop your skills significantly over the next 9 months!)
- would like to work with more in the long run in your career/begin to specialise in

This interest will help sustain you through the more difficult moments of the project!

3. Think about any areas you know to be struggling in your organisation at the moment. Are there services you know have particularly long waits? Are there areas people often mention as being a concern? Are there articles in the wider news about waits in a particular service in your organisation?

4. Think about the questions you have found yourself being asked in the past in your role that you didn't feel you were able to answer. Have people asked you questions about the ideal staffing levels, the future waits,

5. Think about the stakeholders you have good relationships with. Could you reach out to them to have a chat about areas they may be interested in someone doing a deeper dive into?

6. Talk to your manager - they may have more awareness of the key challenges facing the organisation at present.
